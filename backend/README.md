# Backend (Express + Supabase/Firebase)

This backend is a minimal Express skeleton. It contains a sample endpoint for token metadata and a health endpoint.

Quick start

1. cd backend
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Notes:
- Add Supabase or Firebase SDKs and environment variables in `.env` as needed.
- Add endpoints for minting, signatures, or relaying transactions depending on your architecture.
