# Contracts (Hardhat + Solidity)

This folder contains Solidity contracts and a Hardhat scaffold.

Contracts:
- `NFT.sol` — minimal ERC721 minting contract (owner-only mint).
- `Gameplay.sol` — placeholder for gameplay state and logic.
- `Rewards.sol` — placeholder reward mapping and claim skeleton.

Quick start

1. cd contracts
2. npm install
3. npx hardhat test

Notes:
- The contracts use OpenZeppelin. Install dependencies from `package.json`.
- Extend contracts and add access control/logic as required.
